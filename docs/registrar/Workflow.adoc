# Overview

A workflow can be thought of as a sequence of tasks that must be executed in the
specified order.

In this case the tasks are function calls with their arguments.

# Requirements

1) A workflow must be identifiable to the user by a human readable string.
   E.g. "Pay John 5 ETH"
2) A workflow must have the ability to store function selectors in a specified
   order such that they can be sequentially retrieved for execution

# Suggestions

1) A workflow can be a struct containing the name, function selectors in an array
   and a mapping between each function selector and its arguments (arguments may
   also be an array)
