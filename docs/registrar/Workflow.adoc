== Overview

A workflow can be thought of as a sequence of tasks that must be executed in the
specified order.

In this case the tasks are function calls with their arguments.

== Requirements

. A workflow must be identifiable to the user by a human readable string

. A workflow must have the ability to store function selectors in a specified
order such that they can be sequentially retrieved for execution

== Implementation suggestions

A workflow must be identifiable to the user by a human readable string::
. Store a string with their input

A workflow must have the ability to store function selectors in a specified order such that they can be sequentially retrieved for execution::
. A workflow can be a struct containing the name, function selectors in an array
and a mapping between each function selector and its arguments (arguments may
also be an array)
