# Purpose of Document

The purpose of the service register is similar to the Domain Name System (DNS).
It will contain a mapping that is used to look up which contract must be called
for any given workflow ID.

# Overview

In order to execute a workflow there must be an end point location (a contract)
which is called with the functions and arguments that are contained within the
workflow.

The service registry will be a contract which stores the information associated
between the workflow ID and which contract it should act upon.

# Requirements

1) The registry must contain a mapping associating a workflow ID with a contract
that will be called

2) When adding a workflow ID to the mapping only new/unique ID's can be added.

:Note: The generation of the workflow ID is the responsibility of the user controller
and thus it should make sure that a unique ID is created however we will defensively
code anyway

3) If an error occurred and a workflow ID is attempting to be added that already
exists then we should revert and return the gas.
