# Overview

This is the general document that should contain a high level overview of how
the different pieces interact.

The main pieces are:
1) The controller which interacts with registrars and users
2) The registrars which contain lookup information and/or workflows
3) A batcher that pays attention to the workflow to ensure that progress is not lost if gas runs out
4) Authorization mechanism to allow someone else to execute a workflow on behalf of someone else
