# Overview

A workflow consists of a sequence of actions that must be executed in order.
Each action has a gas cost associated with it and thus the workflow may fail if
an insufficient gas amount is passed in.
To prevent the sequence from failing there should be a system that performs the
actions sequentially and keeps track of how many steps have been performed.

If the gas runs out then there will be a number of completed steps with another
number of remaining steps that need to be completed in the workflow.

If possible the batcher would also perform some estimation of the cost of the
next action and if it believes that there is a sufficient amount of gas to perform
the action (such as e.g. 1.5x the amount of gas remaining relative to its estimate)
then it would proceed to perform the action.

Once it believes that there is not enough gas it would exit out returning the
remaining gas while remembering the last step that it has completed in the workflow.
This allows the user to pick up from the last point with another transaction.



# Thoughts for later

- The name batcher sucks
- What exactly is this batcher thing in relation to the steps and implementation of the whole workflow?
  - Where is it in the sequence of steps?
  - What is it a part of?
  - How do things communicate with it?
  - How does it communicate back?
