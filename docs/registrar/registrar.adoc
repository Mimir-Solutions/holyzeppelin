# Overview

A registrar is similar to a lookup system such as Domain Name System (DNS).
It is queried with information such as a workflow ID and a user and it returns
data such as the address of an interface to be queried.


# Thoughts for later
- How many registrars do we need and what functions do they perform?
  - How do we name them to be able to distinguish them?
- How are interfaces added to the registrars and by who?
  - Do we store a mapping of a contract name -> interface?
  - How does passing in a workflow ID and a user allow us to resolve to an interface?
    - We may need to use something other than the ID here like the actual contract name which would be stored in the workflow registrar
    - This registrar would only resolve the contract name to the interface but then we do not need the user either
