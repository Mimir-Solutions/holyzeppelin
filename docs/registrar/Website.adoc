# TODO: I am shit at overviews

== Overview

The website will be required to do a lot of the heavy lifting such as data encoding
and gas estimation because it seems inviable to do so from within the contracts.
Similar to any other front end it will need to present options to the user for
managing their workflows.

== Requirements

. The user should be able to create a new workflow
.. The user should be able to add a function with its parameters
... The user should be able to add as many functions as they want
.. The user should be able to select the order of the functions within the workflow
.. The user should be able to save the workflow
... The workflow must be saved with a unique name human readable name

. The user should be able view all of their workflows

. The user should be able to edit a workflow
.. The associated name of the workflow
.. The functions and their arguments
.. The order of the functions

. The user should be able to delete a workflow

. The user should be able to associate a workflow with a contract address in the
service registry

. The user should be able to remove the association between a workflow and contract

. The user should be able to edit the association to change either the workflow
or the contract

. When a workflow is created or edited the workflow ID should be created/edited
accordingly via the website

. Changing the name of the workflow does not affect its workflow ID


== Possible future features?

. The user should be able to lock a workflow

. The user should be able to remove the lock from the workflow

. The user should be able to delete all workflows that are not locked

. The user should be able to reorder the workflows in the UI instead of having
a predefined order

. The user should be able to associate a workflow with a time for the scheduler

. The user should be able to remove a workflow from the scheduler

. The user should be able to edit the time for a workflow in the scheduler
