== Questions
. How does the data get from the user interface to the user controller
.. Does the javascript encode the data and send it to the front end controller?
.. Does the raw data get sequentially sent to the front end controller and it handles that mess?
.. Can we skip the front end controller and go straight to the user controller?
.. Possible problem with ownership if this is the proxy since we need to delegate design the user controller

== Overview

The front end controller is what the user interface will communicate with.

== Requirements

. When a user signs up / signs in the controller should query its user registry
to check if the user exists

. New users should have a system deployed for them and a record should be stored
within the user registry

. Communications from the front end should be proxied via itself directly to the
user controller
