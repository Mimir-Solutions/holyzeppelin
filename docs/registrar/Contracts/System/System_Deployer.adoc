== Overview

Each user will have their own system deployed for them to prevent
cross-contamination between user actions via a central system.

== Requirements

. When asked to create a new system for the user it should deploy
.. A user controller
.. A workflow hashtable
.. A scheduler
.. A treasury (piggy bank for the executor to pull funds from)
.. A workflow ID generator
.. An executor

. After deploying the contracts the ownership of the contracts should be transferred
to the user
// TODO: how are things linked?
