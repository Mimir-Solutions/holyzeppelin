// TODO: Can we skip the front end controller and go straight to the user controller post deployment?
// TODO: Possible problem with ownership if this is the proxy since we need to delegate design the user controller

== Overview

The front end controller is what the user interface will communicate with.

== Requirements

. Sign up
.. Check user registry and if they are a new user then deploy a new system for them
else revert

. Login
.. Check user registry and if they have a system then login else revert

. New users signing up
.. Deploy a system for them
.. Save a record in the user registry of their address => their user controller address

. Interacting with their system
.. If we can bypass the front end controller after we login to directly communicate
with our user controller then do that
.. If we cannot bypass the front end controller then use it as a proxy to pass
data to the user controller
