== Overview

The hashtable for workflows is a database that will map the workflow ID to the
data describing the workflow.

== Requirements

. Each unique workflow ID will be mapped to a data structure containing information
about the workflow

. The information required about the workflow is
.. The human readable name that identifies the entire workflow
.. Each "block" of data requires
... The human readable function name and its data types
... The function selector equivalent of the function and its data types
... The values that will be used in the workflow corresponding to the data types
... The address of the contract that the function will be called on
... An estimated gas cost to call the function with specific values
// TODO: probably need to separated the workflow templates from the actual workflows
// and thus only store valid workflows here while storing templates elsewhere?

. The workflow name should be editable

. Each block can be edited to the extent that the user can change
.. The human readable function and its data types
.. If the human readable function and its data types is changed then the function
selector should also be updated to reflect this
.. The input values into the function
.. The contract address associated with that function selector
.. The estimated gas should be recalculated based on any of the changes above

. Adding a non-unique ID should revert and return the gas

. Adding a non-unique human readable workflow name should revert and return the gas
// TODO: consider the human name reverting... this may no longer be required as we may no longer require any reverse mappings

. Each workflow should have an order number associated with it so that the front
end can order the workflows
