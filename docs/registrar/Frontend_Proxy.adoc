# Questions
There is uncertainty in some matters therefore here are some things to consider
when reading the document
- Once a user system is deployed are we forced to use the deployment (front end)
system as a proxy to communicate with the user controller or can we directly
communicate with the user controller?
-- Document is assuming the proxy implementation
- Requirements

# Purpose of Document

The purpose of the front end controller is to act as a deployment system which
will deploy an entire system per user for which they are in complete control of.

Once the system is deployed the front end controller will act as a proxy between
the user interface and the user controller.

# Overview

The front end (website) requires a contract to communicate with however for the
purposes of security it is inadvisable to have a universal controller which
every user must interact with in order to perform their workflow. The reason is
that universal access inherently contains the flaw of cross-user contamination
meaning that it may be possible to exploit another user given some sequence of
actions.

To prevent possible contamination each user will have a system deployed for them
and they alone will have control over it.

When an existing user wants to access their system the front end proxy controller
can pass on the actions to the user controller via a mapping of user address =>
user controller address.

The remaining point of exploit is the proxy itself and if that can be eliminated
then the user has an enclosed system just for them.

# Requirements

1) The proxy must know of the users that it has therefore a mapping of user
address => user controller address is required

2) When a user attempts to create a system via signing up the mapping in 1) must
be checked
2.1) User does not exist in the mapping
2.1.1) A new copy of the default system should be deployed for the user
2.1.2) Ownership should be transferred from the proxy to the user
2.1.3) The mapping in 1) should be updated to reflect the new user system
2.1.4) Trigger an event indicating which user just had a new system deployed
2.2) User does exist in the mapping
2.2.1) Gracefully error out and return any gas that remains

3) When a user attempts to log into their system the mapping in 1) must be checked
3.1) User does not exist in the mapping
3.1.1) Gracefully error out and return any gas that remains
3.2) User does exist in the mapping
3.2.1) Perform the verification process through the wallet and load their system
