# Overview

A workflow is simply a sequence of steps that a user has set up.
In this case these steps are function calls with their arguments.


# Use Case: John create a workflow

To create a workflow John will need to enter some information
1) A name to identify the workflow
2) The contract address
3) The functions to be called with their arguments

:Q: How and when do we validate the workflow?

# Use Case: John alters an existing workflow

John should be able to alter
1) The workflow name
2) The functions in the workflow
3) The contract address

:Q: If the contract address is altered then the functions must be altered too?

# Use Case: John deletes one of his workflows

Remove the object from our storage?

# Retrieval of workflow information

Are we queried by the controller with the ID or the name of the workflow?


# Thoughts for later
- I do not see how the controller can communicate with the registrar that looks
  up the interface by a user and workflow ID. That requires some complex mapping
  between a user and all of their contracts or every ID to be mapped to some contracts
