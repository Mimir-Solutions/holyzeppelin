== Overview

Users may directly interact with contracts or via an interface that makes the
interaction smoother. Some users may eventually want to automate the whole process
and thus they require that a contract can act on behalf of them.

== Requirements

. A user should be able to add an address that can perform actions on their behalf

. A user should be able to revoke access from an address that currently has access
to act on behalf of the user

. A user should be able to limit the approved account to specific workflows rather
than global "admin" access
